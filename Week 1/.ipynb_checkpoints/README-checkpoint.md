# Bringing FinTech into Restaurants

## Toast, Inc

### Background

Created in 2011 and launched in 2013, Toast Inc. (“Toast”) started as a consumer payments app for restaurants but has since expanded to offer a complete technology suite for restaurants across:

+ Point of Sale "POS" systems
+ ToastGo handheld hardware
+ Online Ordering
+ Payroll and Team Management

The Point of Sale system is the backbone of what Toast has look to advance for restaurants leveraging technology and integration capabilities.  A Point of Sale “POS” system can be defined as the time and place were a retail transaction is complete.  Back 20 years ago the POS of a small Diner may have been the register by the front door.  When patron had completed their meal, a server would drop off a paper handwritten check that the patron would take up to the register (POS) and pay either with cash or credit card (if they were accepted).  Another example of a POS is at a retail clothing store, it is the place where you bring the items you wish to purchase and provide payment.

While this case study will focus on the Toast POS product offering that is within the Payments/Billing FinTech domain, Toast Capital could fit into the Lending domain. Toast Capital is a product offering from Toast that provides its customers with secure loans on terms that allow borrowers to pay back based on a percentage of what the restaurant makes each day.  On a day when a restaurant had ten thousand dollars of sales, they would pay back a larger percentage of the loan then a day when they had three thousand dollars in sales.  Toast can track all this information due to how integrated their technology is with every aspect of the restaurants they are in.

### History

Founders Steve Fredette, Aman Narang and Jonathan Grim set out to reduce frictions at points of sale for restaurant patrons who wished to split checks an offshoot would be to also reduce the additional work required of the waitstaff who had to meet these requests.  They soon realized that restaurants really needed more than just a new POS platform to accept payments after attempts to overlay a Payment/Billings capability on top of current POS systems restaurants had already purchased. Following this new approach, Toast developed their own POS system which is cloud based and runs on Android. The stated goal of the company is to empower restaurants of all sizes to build great teams, increase revenue, improve operations, and delight their guests through an intuitive all-in-one platform.  Current CFO Tim Brash credits Toast’s success where others such as Groupon and Amazon have pulled out of Point of Sale and restaurant management on the fact that roughly seventy percent of Toast employees have worked in the food service industry.

### Technology

Technology that Toast offers to its customers spans across software and hardware:

+ Touchscreen Point of Sale Terminals
+ Order and pay at the table
+ Handheld Point of Sale Systems
+ Contactless payments
+ Self-order kiosks
+ Kitchen display screens
+ Printers
+ Integrated online ordering

Over the past 5-10 years the Payments/Billing domain with respect to restaurants has expanded to meet other needs every restaurant has; connecting front of house and back of house, inventory and sales tracking, customer award programs, online delivery and pickup options, menu maintain, payroll and even lending.  Toast positioned itself well to expand into these other areas because everything was built on a single platform.  Having all these capabilities on one platform separated Toast from competitors and allowed the company to become a leader in the restaurant technology space.

### Financing 

Toast had its Series A equity round on July 30, 2015 where it raised three million dollars from investors, this was followed the next week with their first and to date only debt financing which was also for thress million.  In total, Toast has raised just over nine hundred million of funding, the most recent being its Series F round on February 14, 2020 which raised four hundred million and valued the company at just under five billion dollars.


### Toast vs. Square

In the Payments/Billing domain Square is a business leader in its ability to take and process payments for merchants.  While Square is more popular with retail and food industries Toast is specific for restaurants. Some high-level comparisons between Toast and Square:

+ **Price:** *Toast is cheaper per month then Square*
+ **Payment Types:** *Toast accepts not only credit cards like Square but also cash as a form of payment*
+ **Payroll:** *Option to integrate payroll included with Toast, an extra cost to leverage via Square*
+ **Link to On-line Ordering:** *Toast offers the ability for a resturant delivery options to be linked to an inhouse delivery option or a number of 3rd party options such as Uber Eats or Grubhub.  In addition Toast links in-house the POS menu to the on-line menu so that if a price or other change needs to be made it can be made in one place.*

A potential area for improvement is for Toast to offer a flat fee for payment processing as Square does.  Today Toast quotes payment processing fees based on the mix of payment types and credit cards a restaurant accepts.  As Toast expands, they may be able to offer a flat fee due to economies of scale.

### Market Size

According to the National Restaurant Association 2020 Industry Sales Projection is nearly nine hundred billion dollars.  Toast has a presence in restaurants across 230+ US cities and given the need for owners to keep costs down there is still a lot of room for growth.  Customer satisfaction/referrals and pentration into new markets in the US and potentially globally should be key metrics and growth plans that Toast tracks.     

### COVID-19

Toast has  been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as the company decided to lay off 1,300 employees or 46% of its workforce in April 2020.  However, given that their business model is proven in that they can help reduce payment frictions and the need for restaurants to continue look to cut cuts Toast will still be a viable FinTech company.  According to BuiltinBoston.com Toast is currently recruiting for 34 positions, a long way from how many people were laid off but a move in the right direction.

### Potential Future Strategies

Consumers today care about where and to what companies their money is going to so Toast can potentially look to provide insights to consumers or the restaurant diners.  Specifically, since Toast is plugged into inventory and ordering for restaurants using its platform perhaps they can build a ranking system that identifies restaurants that align to preferences and beliefs of consumers such as:

+ Create an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) score.  Restaurants who prioritize environmental stability by sourcing produce from local farms or donating a percentage of sales to local social services would get a higher ESG score then those that do not prioritize these efforts.  When a consumer is looking to order food Toast could provide this scoring/ranking.

+ Like a ESG score, Toast could consider developing a Diversity Equity and Inclusion score for restaurants on their platform.  Being aware of DE&I is important for all companies today and if consumers could clearly look at a ranking, they might shift their dollars to businesses who have high DE&I scores that align to their beliefs.
    + An important consideration to developing and rolling out either ESG or DE&I score would be to make sure that it does not alienate restaurants who currently or could use Toast in the future.  It would not be a good business decision to cannibalize its current core client base which is the restaurants to connect with or grow in the  consumer (the restaurants customers) side.
    

+ Another potential growth opportunity focuses on the fact As consumers are more and more health conscious today. A future product offering for Toast could be to identify which restaurants and dishes cater to a particular diet or lifestyle.  Today menus will indicate if a dish is Vegan or Dairy Free but a future step could be for a consumer to indicate they are following a Keto diet and Toast could provide a list of local restaurant options with Keto friendly dishes – which can be ranked by the number of options per restaurant or by customer rating of the Keto dishes.

+ Specific to the Payments/Billing space, Toast could look to offer a payroll option that distributes payroll the same day an employee works.  This would help move funds to workers on the same day they work vs. waiting for the normal two week payroll cycle.
